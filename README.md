# GIS Application in Mining & Geology 

Welcome to a website that is dedicated to articles that focus on GIS in Mining and Geology. I hope these references help with the applciation of different geologic, geophysical, or other methods to GIS.


# GIS in Geology

###### Geologic Modeling Software: 

Miladinović, Milena, et al. “No 19 (2011).” Http://Ume.rgf.bg.ac.rs/, http://ume.rgf.bg.ac.rs/index.php/ume/issue/view/11. 

As computer technology has improved so has available software. In the mining industry there are many different software applications for mining designs Rockware, Rockworks, LogPlot, ERSI, Maptek, and many more applications. The best option for methods for each company can be different. Focusing on ERSI the ArcReader function can be used to look at maps. The ArcCatalog function allows for the use of management of geographic data and spatially analyze the data. The ERSI suite allows for the analysis of different data types spatially. 

This is helpful for me as it allows me to see the other applications that can be used for geologic modeling. This would be helpful to reference for mining and geologic software’s when considering which software to invest in.

###### 3D Modeling 

Ford, Alistair. “The Visualisation of Integrated 3D Petroleum Datasets in Arcgis.” Reseachgate.net, https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alistair-Ford-2/publication/228976050_The_visualisation_of_integrated_3D_petroleum_datasets_in_ArcGIS/links/552544830cf2561f2ac219cf/The-visualisation-of-integrated-3D-petroleum-datasets-in-ArcGIS.pdf.


The publication investigates 2D and  3D mapping tools within ArcGIS. The paper focuses on the specifically on petroleum reserved mapping. The writer focuses on explaining the uses of 3D modeling in mining applications. These uses include mine planning, engineering, and health and safety to name a few. The ArcGIS functions focus on the use of point, line, polygon features for 2D mapping and solid features to accomplish the 3D mapping.  The point features can be used to help define boundaries in a 2D range.  The line features are a collection of points that can be pieced together. The polygon feature allows for lines to be connect to form two dimensional shapes to define regions, boundaries, and other interactions. The solid feature allows for a 3rd dimension to be added, but with great complication. ArcGIS has a multipatch feature that simplifies the process allowing for easy creation of 3D shapes. 

In my application ArcGIS is useful for creating maps of planned drill holes. This can be through a 2D hole collars. It is also useful to created lines that represent depths of the drillholes. In a 3D shape looking a certain type of rock thicknesses to get to the desired rock type can be useful. 


###### Geologic Mapping

Lawal, M. A., et al. “A Simplified GIS and Google-Earth-Based Approach for Lineaments and Terrain Attributes Mapping in a Basement Complex Terrain.” Nature News, Nature Publishing Group, 22 Sept. 2022, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20057-2. 

Geologic mapping has long been used to show rock types, faults, and other stratigraphic features in an area. The use of google earth combine with GIS allow for mapping large areas in shorter amount of time and some more accuracy. The study focused on the Idanre Hills in southwestern Nigeria. The study starts off looking at images that you can see geologic changes in the ground. It moves from that to Lineament density mapping, the application of mapping things such as elevation. The elevation can be pulled and used in raster data or other forms of maps in ArcGIS. The author goes into great detail about the limitations and benefits of this type of mapping. 

In my personal use this could be helpful if a rock unit that we are mining outcrops at surface. This technique would allow for preliminary screening of potential land acquisitions. Mapping elevation and surface outcrops could help with the economics and planning of the mine. 

###### Core Application

Holmes, Elliott M., et al. “Geospatial Management and Analysis of Microstructural Data from San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) Core Samples.” MDPI, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, 14 May 2021, https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/5/332. 
https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/5/332

The author focuses on the analysis of core samples to apply data to GIS. The author was interested in applying spatial visualizations and storing the data in GIS. The data was capture using a camera and other lab-based methods. To store the data HTML is used to store the lab data, while the photographs of are stored in polygon features. The y-data is used to represent depth, while x-axis in this case was chose to be the core size. The depths allow for lines and modeling to be created. The author also applied CL image analysis to help classify the rock material. This was done though creating vector points from the images to create sample groups. Then an unsupervised classification method is applied to determine different vein types. Then the analysis is applied to GIS to provide a view of the classification methods 

This would be helpful for core drilling campaigns. Logging core and then modeling it takes time. This application could help if photographs can be taken and then logged using image classification methodology. It also would be very helpful to have a central place where the core logging, photos, and analysis can be stored for access. This is done mainly in excel files, other software exists but can be expensive. Since GIS is widely used this could provide an easy way to fix the storage issue. 


###### GIS and Remote Sensing

Ezabti, Abubaker, and Verka Jovanović. “GIS and Remote Sensing Application in Geological Mapping and 3D Terrain ...” Researchgate.net, https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Verka-Jovanovic-2/publication/300485817_GIS_and_Remote_Sensing_Application_in_geological_mapping_and_3D_terrain_modeling_a_case_study_in_Eghei_Uplift_Libya/links/58a19a0345851598bab976b2/GIS-and-Remote-Sensing-Application-in-geological-mapping-and-3D-terrain-modeling-a-case-study-in-Eghei-Uplift-Libya.pdf?origin=publication_detail. 

The author is presents how GIS can be used to take geo-data to create geologic maps and 3D models. The author focuses on the use or remoting sensing data with geo data with interpretation in GIS. The study focuses on an area in Libya. The use of satellite images is explained with pre-processing steps listed. The Geologic mapping was done in the field before being digitized for interpretation. The models were then combined to provide both a topographic, geologic, and structural interpretation. 

Geologic mapping is useful for mapping rock units. This allows for interpretation of geologic structural happenings. The ability to apply surface elevation would allow for better modeling for rock unit interpretation. This would allow for a better geologic model and economic interpretation for mining.

###### Groundwater Movement 

   Prasad, R. K., et al. “Deciphering Potential Groundwater Zone in Hard Rock through the Application of GIS - Environmental Geology.” SpringerLink, Springer-Verlag, 25 Aug. 2007, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00254-007-0992-3. 

   The author focuses on the application of remoting sensing with the application of GIS to help with mapping underground water ways. The factors that influence groundwater movement is geology, lineaments, drainage, slope, and  geomorphology. The rock types deposited can influence structures such as weathering, jointing, fractures, or even faults. The lineaments are found using remote sensing analysis. The focus is to determine linear features. The drainage is focused on the runoff density in the area. The slope angle can affect the rate that the water is able to percolate into the ground. The Geomorphology focuses on the features of the area and elevation profile of the area. The Geomorphology is found using remote sensing data. All the data gathered from the factors are inputted into a spatial database. This can be done through scanning, topography building, assigning attributes, and buffering to build a map. Each factor map can all affect the path of groundwater. GIS can use the raster calculation function to be applied to each factor to provide a weights to the information. The results can then be combined to create one map with all features. 

   Groundwater movement is a large concern in the mining industry. Mining pits must be dewatered. This can be done in a variety of ways, using pumps, redirecting streams, redirecting groundwater. In the location that I currently work the use of traditional methods have yielded no results. Being able to apply remote sensing data in GIS could help the mining team find the larger underground waterways to allow for better water diversion.
